# Usability, Accessibility and Inclusion

- **accessibility**: "addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities"
- **usability**: "designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying"; not specific to people with disabilities

---

- **inclusion**: "about diversity, and ensuring involvement of everyone to the greatest extent possible"
    - not just about disability
    - see also: internationalization

# Disability Justice

> Our communities and movements must address the issue of access. There is no way around it. Accessibility is concrete resistance to the isolation of disabled people. Accessibility is nothing new, and we can work to understand access in a broad way, encompassing class, language, childcare, gender-neutral bathrooms as a start.

---

> We must, however, move beyond access by itself. We cannot allow the liberation of disabled people to be boiled down to logistics. We must understand and practice an accessibility that moves us closer to justice, not just inclusion or diversity.
