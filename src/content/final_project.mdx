# Final Project

For the final project in this course, you’ll build a web application of your choosing in a small group.

## Deliverables

- Design document: [CSC 473 Final Project Design Doc Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17QO_0MUGwiwoeEwE7_FyV6sV478RepwMZzEcHOJ8vxs/edit?usp=sharing)
- Your (functioning) application
- Code
- Instructions for how to deploy it locally and/or a link to a live instance
- A brief (approximately) 5 minute demonstration of your application – during the final exam

## FAQ

- How many people can be in a group?
  - 2 or 3 – you want someone to split the work with
- Will we get a rubric?
  - Yes, but not today.
- What features does my application need to have?
  - The user should interact with it via the browser (i.e., it should be a webapp)
  - You should store some kind of data in a database
  - This means you probably want to support accounts/login, but it's possible your application doesn't need it
- What technologies can I use?
  - Please stick to the TS/JS - React - Express stack we’ve been using in class
  - You can use something like Firebase or Back4App, but your application needs to have both a frontend and a backend component, so you can't use them for _everything_ and not have your own server.
